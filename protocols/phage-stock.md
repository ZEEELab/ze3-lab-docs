# ZE3 Lab Phage Stock Protocol 

## Materials: 
- Overnight host cultures containing host antibiotics 
- Frozen phage stock
- Chloroform 

## Protocol 
1. Dilute 100-200 microliters of overnight host culture into a fresh culture containing 4 mL media.
2. Using a pipette tip, scrap the top of the frozen phage stock and eject the tip into the culture containing the diluted host. Incubate overnight. 
3. Transfer the culture into a 15mL conical tube (to be able to spin down culture)
4. In the media room Fume Hood, prepare a small volume of chloroform into a secondary container (best practice would be transferring 500 microliters into a small beaker) 
5. Transfer 40 microliters of chloroform into the culture (in the hood!!!) 
6. Vortex the culture well to lysis any cells containing phage 
7. Spin the culture down 5-10 minutes at 4,000 rmp in the large centrifuge 
8. Remove the supernatant and transfer to a fresh tube. Add 40 microliters of chloroform for long term storage at 4C to help prevent bacterial growth
