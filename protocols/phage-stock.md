#ZE3 High Titer Phage Stock Protocol 

- Grow an overnight culture of the permissive host (see phage facts sheets to determine which host to use)
- Dilute (1:10) of the overnight host culture into new cultures
- Create 2 cultures. One containing host + phage and one containing host only as a control 
- Shake the cultures at 200rpm at 37℃ for 30-60 minutes to allow host to enter exponential phase of growth 
- Add phage to the host + phage culture 
  - Frozen stock: using a pipette and sterile tip, scrap a decent ice chunk from the tube. Mix the ice chunk into the culture by pipetting up and down.
  - Plate: using a pipette and a sterile tip, pick an isolated plaque from the plate. Mix the picked plaque into the culture by pipetting up and down.
- Place the cultures back in the shaker. Lysis should occur between 6-8 hours. You can also allow the cultures to sit overnight. 
-Determine the method to lysis any extra cells/isolate phage (see phage facts sheet) 
  - Chloroform 
    - Add 1% chloroform to the cultures and vortex well 
    - Spin cultures at 5,000rmp for 5-10 minutes 
    - Pour off supernatant into a new, sterile tube and add 1% chloroform 
    - Store in the cold room 
  - Heat Shock
    - Heat shock the culture at 65℃ for 20 minutes 
    - Spin cultures at 5,000rmp for 5-10 minutes to pellet the cell debris 
    - Store in the cold room
