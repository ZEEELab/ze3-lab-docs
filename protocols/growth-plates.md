# ZE<sup>3</sup> Lab Plate Protocols

## LB Plates
To a 2L flask, add:  
- 40g LB agar 
- 1,000mL ddH2O

Autoclave flask on liquid cycle 2. Allow flask and agar to slightly cool. Pour agar into sterile plates and let them sit on the bench for 2-3 days.

## LB + Antibiotic Plates 
To a 2L flask, add: 
- 40g LB agar 
- 1,000mL ddH2O

Autoclave agar on liquid cycle 2. Once slightly cooled, add antibiotics using correct concentrated amounts from premade alliquotes. Pour agar into sterile plates and allow to cool on the bench for 2-3 days. *(can adjust protocol for smaller batches of LB antibiotic plates)* 

## M9 Minimal Media Plates + Glucose  
In a 500mL bottle, make the M9 Media:
- 500mL ddH2O
- 6g Sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4)
- 3g Potassium phosphate (KH2PO4)
- 0.5g Sodium chloride (NaCl) 
- 1g Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)

In a 2L flask, make the Agar: 
- 500mL ddH2O
- 16g Agar

Autoclave bottles of media and agar separately using liquid cycle 2. Once slightly cooled, combine bottles and add the following: 
- 1mL 1M Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4)
- 1mL 0.1 Calcium chloride (CaCl2) 
- 10mL 10% Glucose 

Pour into sterile plates and let them cool overnight on the lab bench. Leave plates on the bench for 2-3 days to fully solidify.
