# ZE<sup>3</sup> Phage Titer Protocol 
## Day 1:
- Grow up the host strain in a liquid culture overnight.
- Grow up phage (may need to isolate phage from culture by pelleting or chloroform) 
## Day 2: 
- Loosen the cap of the soft agar bottle and microwave in increments of 2-3 minutes until agar is totally melted. Be sure to swirl the bottle to help melt the agar. 
- When the bottle of soft agar is manageable, pour 3 mL of the agar into small test tubes and place in a 60 degree hot block to keep agar warm. 
- Using a 96 well plate, complete a serial dilution of the phage. Start with 180uL of M9 in each well and add 20ul of phage (this starts the first 10x dilution). 
- Add 100ul of the host strain into the soft agar aliquots.  
- Pour top agar over the plate and rotate the plate rapidly until the agar is evenly distributed. 
- Take 2ul of the diluted phage and spot it on the plate. Can section the plate to fit many different dilutions to obtain countable plaques.
- Let the plates sit with their lids slightly open near the flame for 10-15 minutes, or until spots are dry. 
- Flip upside down and incubate overnight.
## Day 3:
- Count the number of plaques on the plate. 
- Complete calculation to determine phage titer.
    - n x 10 x d = PFU/mL 
    - n = plaques and d = dilution  

## Notes: 
- If the soft agar seems grainy, this means the aliquot cooled off too much before pouring over the plate.
