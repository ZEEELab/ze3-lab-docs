- Autoclave 

## 100mL 50mM CaCl2 + 20% Glycerol 
- 0.735g CaCl2 dihydrate  
- 20mL glycerol 
- Bring up to 100mL with ddH2O
- Autoclave 

## DH5ɑ Competent Cells
1. Inoculate 2 mL of LB media with stock DH5ɑ Competent Cells stored at -80C. Incubate overnight at 37C. 
2. Dilute 1mL of the overnight culture in 100mL of LB media. Incubate until OD600 = 0.6 (about 2 hours). 
3. Prechill 50mL conical tubes on ice. Transfer cells to chilled tubes and incubate on ice for 30 minutes. 
4. Spin the cells down at 2,500rpm for 5 minutes. 
5. Pour off supernatant and resuspend cells using COLD 50mM CaCl2. Incubate on ice for 60 minutes. 
6. Spin the cells down at 2,500rpm for 5 minutes. 
7. Pour off supernatant and resuspend cells using COLD 50mM CaCl2 + 20% glycerol. 
8. Aliquot into 1.5mL prechilled tubes. Best practice is chilling tubes in ice, transferring cells, and flash freezing the cells using  a bucket of dry ice. 
9. Store at -80C.
