# ZE<sup>3</sup> Liquid Media Protocols 

## SOB Media
To 800mL ddH<sup>2</sup>O, add the following: 
- 5 g Yeast extract 
- 20 g Tryptone 
- 0.5 g Sodium chloride (NaCl)
- 0.186 g Potassium chloride (KCl) 
- 2.4 g Magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>)

Adjust the pH to 7.5 using 1M Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (roughly 25 mL). Add ddH<sup>2</sup>O to the final volume of 1 L. Autoclave on a liquid cycle.  

## SOC Media 
SOC media is SOB media with glucose. Follow the protocol for SOB media but bring the final volume up to 960 mL instead of 1 L. Autoclave media on a liquid cycle. Once the bottle has cooled slightly, add 40 mL glucose (this will make a final concentration of 0.4% glucose). 

**Note:** SOC media is extremely rich which makes it easy to contaminate. Therefore, smaller volumes of media in bottles are suggested. 

## LB Media 
To 1 L of ddH2O, add 25 g LB Broth. Aliquot into separate media bottles and autoclave.
