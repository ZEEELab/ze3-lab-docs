# ZE<sup>3</sup> Liquid Media Protocols 

## SOB Media
To 800mL ddH<sup>2</sup>O, add the following: 
- 5 g Yeast extract 
- 20 g Tryptone 
- 0.5 g Sodium chloride (NaCl)
- 0.186 g Potassium chloride (KCl) 
- 2.4 g Magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>)

Adjust the pH to 7.5 using 1M Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (roughly 25 mL). Add ddH<sup>2</sup>O to the final volume of 1 L. Autoclave on a liquid cycle.  

## SOC Media 
SOC media is SOB media with glucose. Follow the protocol for SOB media but bring the final volume up to 960 mL instead of 1 L. Autoclave media on a liquid cycle. Once the bottle has cooled slightly, add 40 mL glucose (this will make a final concentration of 0.4% glucose). 

**Note:** SOC media is extremely rich which makes it easy to contaminate. Therefore, smaller volumes of media in bottles are suggested. 

## LB Media 
To 1 L of ddH2O, add: 
- 25 g LB Broth
- Aliquot into separate media bottles and autoclave.

## 10% Glucose 
To a small media bottle, add: 
- 90 mL ddH<sub>2</sub>O
- 10 g glucose 
- Autoclave 

## 80% Glycerol
To a small media bottle, add:
- 80 mL glycerol 
- 20mL ddH<sub>2</sub>O 
- Mix well, does not like to go into solution easily 
- Autoclave 

## 5x M9 Salts
To 1 L of ddH<sub>2</sub>O add:
- 56.4 g 5x M9 Minimal Salts
- Can keep in 1 L bottles or aliquot into smaller volumes 
- Autoclave 

## 1x M9 Salts 
In a large 1L media bottle, add: 
- 800 mL of  ddH<sub>2</sub>O
- 200 mL **5x** M9 Salts  
- Autoclave 

After autoclaving and the media has slightly cooled, add: 
- 1 mL 1M Magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>)
- 1 mL 0.1 Calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) (100 uL 1M  Calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>))
- 1 mL Thiamine (B1) 

**Note:** These bottles of M9 do not contain glucose, add glucose to cultures containing M9 media before adding cells! (Add 10 microliters of glucose per 1 mL M9)
