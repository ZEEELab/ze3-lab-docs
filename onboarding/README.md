## Parking Services 
- You will obtain your physical parking permit through the Parking Office (link)

## Lab Documents and Communications 
- Slack 
  - Our lab uses Slack to Communicate with each other. You will be added into the chat by Luis
  - Slack has the ability to create different channels related to different topics. For our lab, we have a general channel that surrounds work-related announcements and communications, a random channel to talk about non-work related topics (films, food, etc.), and an ordering channel where you list things that need to be ordered and stocked in the lab 
  - Slack is also a great way to get in touch with people individually
